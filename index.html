      <p1>I am a human code ;)</p1>
      <h1>Let's see... Where was I born... </h1>
      <p>I was born on Earth, within the continent of South America--a country called Guyana, which is made up of the British, French, and Dutch; and although my last name is French--unfortunately for myself, I do not speak it. But luckily for me I was raised in the big Apple...yay for me!!!</p>
      <h1>What I love to do is...</h1>
      <p>I love to ride horses, learn about cumputers, volunteering for NYC Cares, learning about complex things that challenge my mind, watching documentaries, star-gazing (astrology), taking pictures of the sky. I would also love to travel around the world once I can afford it some day.</p>
      <h1>My dream job is to become...</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to become the Goddess of Egypt, I am not certain what the Goddess job entails--but, I undoubtedly LOVE, LOVE the job title, hehehe. But I would also love to become a cellphone Applications Developer, my preference is more so on developing public safety appications.</p>
      <h1>I reside in the heart of NYC--Astoria</h1>
      <p>I call Astoria, the heart of NYC because I personally believe love is alsways in the air. You will ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS see couples holding hands all the time here. We have fancy, but not to expensive restaurants where you usually see family gatherings and friends laughing. And, unlike the city where you can see all the above that I mentioned--you won't have people bumping into you... geez that get annoying!!!
      </p>
      <h1>My desires of becoming a web-developer...</h1>
      <p>Once I become a web-developer, my desires are to create pages of insightful and meaningful information for users to appreciate and obtain the most use out of.</p>
